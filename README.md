## Introduction

Go, also known as Golang, is an open-source programming language developed by Google. It's designed for simplicity, reliability, and efficient performance, especially in large-scale distributed systems.

## Installation

To get started with Go, follow these steps:

1. Download and install Go from the official website: [Go Downloads](https://golang.org/dl/)
2. Set up your workspace and GOPATH environment variable by following the instructions [here](https://golang.org/doc/gopath_code.html).
3. Verify your installation by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   go version
