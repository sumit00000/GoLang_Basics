Five reasons yo choose Golang
1 --> Build time : when we  want to deploy application we need to Build it first and build process is held on CI CD pipeline . As fast our application is 
      is build as better. we use less resourses of CI CD if it build fast and do fast testing thats Go build fast.

2 --> Fast Startup : we we need to scale our project then do upscale of project we need to start new instances very quickly so startup time matters.
      Go is very fast because Go programe is compile directly in machine code. becauses od directly execution in machine code then the intermidate steps
      like runtime initilize are not need because it execution in machine code.

3 --> Performance and Efficiency : Go programes  use very efficient way of server resources like memory and cpu, memory useage is very less and it concurrency
      model  utilze cpu in very proper way or light weight threads thats why Go Lang utilize very efficient way of its resources.

** becauseit is a machine code thats why its Performance is very good

4 --> Concurrency Model : Go lang have Goroutines concurrency model. Goroutines are lightweight threads of execution managed by the Go runtime 
      because of Goroutines lightweight threads it utilize all cpur cores  very efficient way.

5 --> Static typing and compilation : In Go Lang have Static typing in which varibles are declared and its type is defined an dthis is good. because 
      In compilation phase if there is an error then it catch in compile time.
      In non Static language if there is an error then we catch in production not get which compilation

** when we build programe then the file size of executable file (programe executable in a single file) is very small as compare to other languages
